iOS-Template-iOS5
=================

Default iOS Xcode template project to export or fork for iOS 5.0+ projects.

I use this base template when I want to start a new project quickly, with a nice set of warnings and file structure.

Notes:

* ARC enabled
* Configuration file based
* Includes a static library project, linked to the main iOS app project
* Includes a set of strict warnings
* There are a number of TODOs marked through the xcconfig files that may need to be addressed prior to using this in production.

Feedback welcome!
